# v2.2.2 - 2024-05-23 - APPROVED

* In JSON schema validation:
  * Change `dataset.description` data type from `array` to `string`.
  * Change `dataset.column.isPrimaryKey` data type from `string` to `boolean`.
  * Change `price.priceAmount` data type from `string` to `number`.
  * Change `slaProperties.value` data type from `string` to `oneOf[string, number]`.
  * Change `slaProperties.valueExt` data type from `string` to `oneOf[string, number]`.
* Update [examples](docs/examples/README.md) to adhere to JSON schema.
* Full example from README directs to [full-example.yaml](docs/examples/all/full-example.odcs.yaml).
* Add in mkdocs for creating a [documentation website](https://bitol-io.github.io/open-data-contract-standard/). Check [building-doc.md](building-doc.md).
* Add vendors page [vendors.md](vendors.md). Feel free to add anyone there.


# v2.2.1 - 2023-12-18 - REPLACED BY V2.2.2

* Reformat quality examples to be valid YAML.
* Type of definition for authority have standard values: `businessDefinition`, `transformationImplementation`, `videoTutorial`, `tutorial`, and `implementation`.
* Add in `isUnique`, `primaryKeyPosition`, `partitionKeyPosition`, and `clusterKeyPosition` to `column` definition.
* Add [JSON schema](https://github.com/bitol-io/open-data-contract-standard/blob/main/schema/odcs-json-schema.json) to validate YAML files for v2.2.1.
* Integrated as part of [Bitol](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/bitol/).
* Reformat Markdown tables.


# v2.2.0 - 2023-07-27 - REPLACED BY V2.2.1

* New name to Open Data Contract Standard.
* `templateName` is now called `standardVersion`, v2.2.0 parsers should account for this change and support both to avoid a breaking change.
* Added support for `authoritativeDefinitions` at the table level.
* Added many examples.
* Various improvements and typo corrections.
* Finalization of fork under AIDA User Group.


# v2.1.1 - 2023-04-26 - REPLACED BY V2.2.0

# v2.1.0 - 2023-03-23 - REPLACED BY V2.1.1

## Data Quality
The data contract adds elements specifically for interfacing with the Data Quality tooling. 

Additions:
* quality (table level & column level check):
* templateName (called standardVersion since v2.2.0)
* dimension
* type
* severity
* businessImpact
* scheduleCronExpression 
* customProperties
* columns
* isPrimaryKey

## Physical names
The data contract is a logical construct; we add more specific links to the physical world.

## Service-level agreement
The service-level agreements not previously used are more detailed to follow the DP QoS pattern. See SLA.

## Other
Removed the weight for system ratings from the data contract. Their default values remain.

# v2.0.0 - REPLACED BY V2.1.0
