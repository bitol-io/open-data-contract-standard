# History

## Version 2.x and Later
Starting with v2.2.0, it is maintained by a 501c6 non-profit organization called [AIDA User Group (Artificial Intelligence, Data, and Analytics User Group)](https://aidaug.org). On November 30th, 2023, [AIDA User Group](https://aidaug.org) and the [Linux Foundation AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/) joined forces to create [Bitol](https://bitol.io). Bitol englobes ODCS, ODPS, and future standards & tools.

## Early Version at PayPal
Formerly known as the data contract template, this standard is used to implement Data Mesh at [PayPal](https://about.pypl.com/). PayPal uses data contracts in many ways, but this [article](https://medium.com/paypal-tech/the-next-generation-of-data-platforms-is-the-data-mesh-b7df4b825522) from the [PayPal Technology blog](https://medium.com/paypal-tech) gives a good introduction. Version 1 was never released.
