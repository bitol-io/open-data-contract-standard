# History

## Version 3.1.x
As data contracts are becoming more popular, more needs for data quality, internal/external referencing, more infrastructure elements, better support & team management appeared. This is the core of v3.1.x a minor (in semantic versioning) major (in features) non-breaking evolution over the previous versions.

ODCS v3.1.0 was released in December 2025.

## Version 3.0.x
ODCS version 3.0.0 introduced a new design and breaking changes with version 2.x. The needs were motivated by some remaining PayPal-specific elements and a willingness to ease migration from other standards, such as DataContract.com's original standard.

ODCS v3.0.0 was released in October 2024.

## Version 2.x and Later
Starting with v2.2.0, it is maintained by a 501c6 non-profit organization called [AIDA User Group (Artificial Intelligence, Data, and Analytics User Group)](https://aidaug.org). On November 30th, 2023, [AIDA User Group](https://aidaug.org) and the [Linux Foundation AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/) joined forces to create [Bitol](https://bitol.io). Bitol englobes ODCS, ODPS, and future standards & tools.

## Early Version at PayPal
Formerly known as the data contract template, this standard is used to implement Data Mesh at [PayPal](https://about.pypl.com/). PayPal uses data contracts in many ways, but this [article](https://medium.com/paypal-tech/the-next-generation-of-data-platforms-is-the-data-mesh-b7df4b825522) from the [PayPal Technology blog](https://medium.com/paypal-tech) gives a good introduction. Version 1 was never released.
