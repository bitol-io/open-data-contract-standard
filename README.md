## What is a Data Contract?

### The basics of a data contract
A data contract defines the agreement between a data producer and consumers. A data contract contains several sections:

* [Fundamentals](docs/README.md#fundamentals).
* [Schema](docs/README.md#schema).
* [Data quality](docs/README.md#data-quality).
* [Support & communication channels](docs/README.md#support-and-communication-channels)
* [Pricing](docs/README.md#pricing)
* [Team](docs/README.md#team)
* [Roles](docs/README.md#roles)
* [Service-level agreement (SLA)](docs/README.md#service-level-agreement-sla).
* [Infrastructures & servers](docs/README.md#infrastructure-and-servers)
* [Custom properties](docs/README.md#custom-properties).

### History
Formerly known as the data contract template, this standard is used to implement Data Mesh at [PayPal](https://about.pypl.com/). Starting with v2.2.0, it is maintained by a 501c6 non-profit organization called [AIDA User Group (Artificial Intelligence, Data, and Analytics User Group)](https://aidaug.org). On November 30th, 2023, [AIDA User Group](https://aidaug.org) and the [Linux Foundation AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/) joined forces to create [Bitol](https://bitol.io). Bitol englobes ODCS and future standards & tools.

### How does PayPal use Data Contracts?
PayPal uses data contracts in many ways, but this [article](https://medium.com/paypal-tech/the-next-generation-of-data-platforms-is-the-data-mesh-b7df4b825522) from the [PayPal Technology blog](https://medium.com/paypal-tech) gives a good introduction.
