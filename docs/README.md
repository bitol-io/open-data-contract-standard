# Open Data Contract Standard

## Executive Summary

This document describes the keys and values expected in a YAML data contract, per the **Open Data Contract Standard**. It is divided in multiple sections. Each section starts with at least an example, followed by the definition of each field/key.

For more details, see the sections below:

1. [Fundamentals (fka demographics)](./fundamentals.md)
2. [Schema](./schema.md)
3. [References](./references.md)
4. [Data Quality](./data-quality.md)
5. [Support & Communication Channels](./support-communication-channels.md)
6. [Pricing](./pricing.md)
7. [Team](./team.md)
8. [Roles](./roles.md)
9. [Service-Level Agreement](./service-level-agreement.md)
10. [Infrastructures & Servers](./infrastructures-servers.md)
11. [Custom & Other Properties](./custom-other-properties.md)

## Notes

* The sections above contain example values. We carefully reviewed the consistency of those values, but we cannot guarantee that there are no errors. If you spot one, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/AIDAUserGroup/open-data-contract-standard/issues).
* Some fields have a `null` value: even if it is equivalent to not having the field in the contract, we wanted to have the field for illustration purposes.
* The contract should be **platform agnostic**. If you think this is not the case, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/AIDAUserGroup/open-data-contract-standard/issues).
